# countdown-haskell

A solver for the numbers game as played on the TV show "Countdown",
written in Haskell.

## Building and running the solver

The application is built using the `stack` tool. Assuming that you have
`stack` installed, you can enter the following commands, with the
root directory of a clone of this repository as the current working
directory:

* `stack build` to build the application
* `stack test` to build the application and run the unit tests
* `stack exec countdown-exe [args]` to run the application.
